#<a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction

  <br>
  <br>

  A **hypothesis test** is a standard procedure for testing a claim about a property of a population. A formal hypothesis test has few components which includes null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, test statistics, p-value, tail of test, type I and type II error. 
  
  <br>
  
  A **population paramter** is a statistical measure that for a given population is fixed and can be used in the description of that population. Proportion, $p$, population mean, $\mu$ and population standard deviation, $\sigma$ are the examples of population paramter.
  
  <br>
  
  The **null hypothesis** which denoted by $H_0$ is a statement that the value of population parameter is assumed to be true until it is declared false. For an instance, the mean height of male secondary school students is 162 cm. The population parameter here is refer to the mean height and its value, 162 cm is true unless we prove it's wrong. 
  
  <br>
  
  $H_0$: $\mu$ = 162cm
  
  <br>
  
  The **alternative hypothesis** which denoted by $H_1$ is a statement that the population parameter has a value that somehow differs from the value specified in the null hypothesis, $H_0$. Let continue from previous example, our null hypothesis, $H_0$  has stated that the mean height of male secondary school students is 162 cm, so our alternative hypothesis for this case, $H_1$ here can be the mean height of male secondary school students not equal to 162 cm, less than 162 cm or more than 162 cm.
  
  <br>
  
   $H_1$: $\mu$ $\ne$ 162cm          
   $H_1$: $\mu$ < 162cm  
   $H_1$: $\mu$ > 162cm 
   
   <br>
  
  While **test statistic** is a value that we compute from the sample of data and it is crucial in determining whether our null hypothesis, $H_0$ is rejected or not.
  
  <br>
  
  A **p-value** is a probability that we compute from test statistic. It's just like test statistic which used in decision making on whether we should reject the claim from null hypothesis, $H_0$.
  
  <br>
  
  A hypothesis test can be a **one-tailed test** or **two-tailed test** depends on the situation. A one-tailed test can be divided into a left-tailed and right-tailed test. If the sign in the null hypothesis, $H_0$ is equal (=), then a two-tailed test should be performed instead of one-tailed test. For a left-tailed test, the sign for the value of population parameter in the null hypothesis, $H_0$ should be greater than equal ($\ge$), while for a right-tailed test, sign for the null hypothesis, $H_0$ is less than equal ($\le$). 
  
  <br>

  A **type I error** occurs when we reject the true null hypothesis, $H_O$ while a **type II error** occurs when a false null hypothesis, $H_0$ is not rejected. The probability of making type I error is known as significance level, $\alpha$ and the probability of making type II error is denoted as $\beta$. From the previous example, type I error is the error occured when we reject the true mean height of male secondary school students which is 162 cm. However, type II error from above case is the mean height of male secondary school students is not equal to 162 cm but we do not reject the false statement.

# One-Sample Hypothesis Testing


  <br>
  <br>
  
## <a id="Hypothesis test about a population mean, $\mu$"></a>Hypothesis test about a population mean, $\mu$  
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  In tests of hypothesis about a single population mean, $\mu$, we perform Z-test when the sample is sufficiently large (n $\ge$ 30).  
  
  <br>
  <br>

### <a id="Z-test"></a>Z-test

  <br>
  <br>
  
  Since base library of R doesn't provide the function of Z-test, so we have to download and install the required R package, ["BSDA"](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/BSDA/versions/1.2.0) which stands for **Basic Statistics and Data Analysis** from CRAN.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r message=FALSE, eval=F}

install.packages("BSDA")          
# Install required R package

```

  <br>
  <br>
  
  Then we load the library in console and use z.test( ) function to check the claim of the null hypothesis, $H_0$.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r message=F, comment=NA, eval=F}

library("BSDA")                   
# Load "BSDA" 

z.test(x, alternative = "two.sided"/"greater"/"less", mu, sigma.x, conf.level)
# Z-test

```

#### Example 1
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  A marketing department of a branch company claims that the mean time of their staffs late to work on Monday is 5 minutes with a standard deviation of 1.29 minutes. The human resource department from headquarter of that company wishes to check the claims whether it is true or not in order to improve employee's discipline. A sample of 35 people from marketing department late to work time in minutes on a Monday is determined and recorded. The collected sample data is indicated as below:
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r message=F, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Times <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Number, ~Late.time.in.minutes,
        1,                     2,
        2,                    10,
        3,                     7,
        4,                     8,
        5,                     8,
        6,                     0,
        7,                     7,
        8,                     6,
        9,                     1,
       10,                     0,
       11,                     1,
       12,                     5,
       13,                     8,
       14,                     8,
       15,                     6,

  )

require(knitr)
require(kableExtra)
kable_styling(
              kable(Times, digits = 3, row.names = FALSE, align = "c",
              caption = NULL, format = "html"),
        bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
        position = "center", full_width = FALSE) 

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r}

late_time= read.csv(file.choose())                       
# Read file into R

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r eval=F}

library("BSDA")
# Load "BSDA" package

late_to_work= late_time$Late.time.in.minutes                          
# Store data into "late_to_work" 

z.test(late_to_work, alternative="two.sided", mu=5, sigma.x=1.29,conf.level = 0.95)  
# Z-test with 5% significance level

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}

library("BSDA")

late_to_work= late_time$Late.time.in.minutes                          

z.test(late_to_work, alternative="two.sided", mu=5, sigma.x=1.29,conf.level = 0.95)  

```

  <br>
  <br>
  
  $H_0$: $\mu$ = 5 minutes                                                           
  
  $H_1$: $\mu$ $\ne$ 5 minutes
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  We reject our null hypothesis, $H_0$ when p-value is less than significance level, $\alpha$. From the above summary, p = 0.359 is greater than $\alpha$ = 0.05.  
  
  We also can have a look on 95% confidence interval. Since the population mean, $\mu$ 5 minutes is within the 95% confidence interval = (4.37263 , 5.22737), so we do not reject the null hypothesis, $H_0$.  
  
  Thus, there is insuficient evidence to conclude that the mean late time of marketing staffs to work on Monday is not equal to 5 minutes. 
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

### T-test

  <br>
  <br>
  
  In tests of hypothesis about a single population mean, $\mu$, we perform T-test when
  
  * The sample is small (n<30).
  * Standard deviation, $\sigma$ of the population is **not known**.
  * The sample is drawn from a population which is approximately normally distributed.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r eval=FALSE}

t.test(x, alternative = "two.sided"/"greater"/"less", mu, conf.level)
# T-test 

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
#### Example 2

  <br>
  <br>
  
  A company's marketing department claims that the average time of their staffs late to work on Monday is 5 minutes with a standard deviation of 1.29 minutes. As a human resource staff, you are required to test the claims whether it is longer than 5 minutes. A sample of 15 people from marketing department late to work time in minutes on a Monday is determined and recorded. The sample data is indicated as below:
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r message=F, echo=FALSE}

Times_2 <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Number, ~Late.time.in.minutes,
        1,                     9,
        2,                     3,
        3,                     9,
        4,                     3,
        5,                    10,
        6,                     1,
        7,                     7,
        8,                     2,
        9,                     5,
       10,                     7,
       11,                     6,
       12,                     9,
       13,                     6,
       14,                     1,
       15,                     6
  )

require(knitr)
require(kableExtra)
kable_styling(
              kable(Times_2, digits = 3, row.names = FALSE, align = "c",
              caption = NULL, format = "html"),
        bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
        position = "center", full_width = FALSE) 

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r eval=FALSE}

late_time_min= read.csv(file.choose())
# Read file into R

late_time_min= late_time_min$Late.time.in.minutes                          
# Store data into "late_time_min" 

t.test(late_time_min, alternative="greater", mu=5, conf.level = 0.95)  
# T-test with 5% significance level

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r comment=NA, echo=F, message=F}

late_time_min= read.csv(file.choose())
# Read file into R

late_time_min= late_time_min$Late.time.in.minutes                          
# Store data into "late_time_min" 

t.test(late_time_min, alternative="greater", mu=5, conf.level = 0.95)  

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  $H_0$: $\mu$ = 5 minutes                                                           
  
  $H_1$: $\mu$ > 5 minutes
  
  <br>
  
  From the above summary, p = 0.2271 is greater than $\alpha$ = 0.05.  
  
  We also can have a look on 95% confidence interval. Since the population mean, $\mu$ 5 minutes is within the 95% confidence interval = (4.22706 , Inf), so we do not reject the null hypothesis, $H_0$.  
  
  Thus, there is insuficient evidence to conclude that the mean late time to work of marketing staffs on Monday is not equal to 5 minutes.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

### Small sample size with known standard deviation, $\sigma$
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  Perform [Z-test](#Z-test) instead of T-test for small sample size when:
  
  * The sample size is small (n<30).
  * Standard deviation, $\sigma$ of the population is **known**.
  * The sample is drawn from a population which is approximately normally distributed.

  <br>
 
## <a id="Hypothesis test about a population proportion, p"></a>Hypothesis test about a population proportion, p

  <br>
  <br>
  
  In tests of hypothesis about a single population proportion, p, we perform Z-test when the sample is large (np>5, nq>5).  
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
### Z-test (proprotion)

  <br>
  <br>

```{r eval=F}

prop.test(x, n, p, alternative="greater", correct=FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)            
# Z-test for population proportion

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
#### Example3

  <br>
  <br>
  
  A company's marketing department claims that at most 30% of their staffs are tend to be late to work in July. In September of the same year, staffs from human resource department wish to know whether the percentage has changed(become lower) after the training program was conducted in August. A sample of 250 marketing staffs showed that 39 of them are tend to be late to work.

  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r eval=F}

prop.test(39, 250, 0.30, alternative = "less", correct= FALSE, conf.level = 0.975)            

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r message=F, echo=F, comment=NA}

prop.test(39, 250, 0.30, alternative = "less", correct= FALSE, conf.level = 0.975)    

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  $H_0$ = $p$ = 0.30
  
  $H_1$ = $p$ < 0.30
  
  <br>
  
  From the above summary, the p-value less than the significance level, $\alpha$ which is equal to 0.025. 
  
  Besides, the population proportion, $p$ = 0.3 is not within the 97.5% confidence interval (0.0000000 , 0.2061459). 
  
  Thus, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the percentage of marketing staffs tend to be late to work after attended training program is less than 30%.
