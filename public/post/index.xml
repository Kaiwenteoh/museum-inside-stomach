Introduction
A hypothesis test is a standard procedure for testing a claim about a property of a population. A formal hypothesis test has few components which include null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, test statistics, tail of test, type I and type II error.

The null hypothesis which denoted by \(H_0\) is a statement that the value of population parameter is assumed to be true until it is declared false.</description>

      <description>During my semester one in year two, I was given the opportunity to take part in Watson analytics competition which organised by IBM Watsons annually. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I did learnt a lot of things from it. One of it is how to make use of R in wrangling datasets. It was my first time to join and words can’t explain my feelings and gratitude to my academic advisor for her approach, guidance and patience.</description>
