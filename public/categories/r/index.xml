Summary

Background
Last week Saturday, I attended an Excel workshop which is organised by my course society at my campus. On that day, I have learnt some basic techniques and concepts in Microsoft Excel. Overall, the learning topic of the day can be categorized into three sub-sections which are lookup functions, logical functions and text functions.</description>

      <description>Corrr package
From my previous post, I did mention about the use of network plot from ‘corrr’ package in visualizing correlation matrices. So, for this time, I’m going to share with you on how to create your own correlation network plot by using ‘corrr’ package in a quick way and also how do we actually interpret it in short.

Installation
Download and install the ‘corrr’ and ‘magrittr’ R packages from CRAN for the first time before we can make use of the functions from it.</description>

      <description>World Bank is an ideal place for us to access global development data. We can always search suitable open data by relevant keyword and download it in any format we prefer (CSV, XML, EXCEL).
