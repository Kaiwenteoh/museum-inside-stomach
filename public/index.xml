      <description>About MeHi, my name is Kaiwen Teoh but you can just call me Kalvin. I’m a second-year student who is currently studying Statistical Computing and Operations Research at University Tunku Abdul Rahman in Perak, Malaysia. I don’t cook but I do like carbonara spaghetti, ikan bakar, almond dessert, and many more.

BlogThis blog is about statistics, operations research, data analysis and its visualization while using mainly R, and a little bit of my life.</description>

      <description>Yes, I finally got my internship for the coming new trimester. Even though going that company is not my original plan and it is located quite far away from my bed but well, half a loaf is better than none. I’m still going to work there and I appreciate it.
One of the interesting parts that I want to share here is after my interview via Skype, I was given a R test to show my ability in analytic skill as well as familiarity in R programming(even though not so good but I have to).</description>

Lookup functions in R
Text functions in R
Lookup functions in Excel
Text functions in Excel
Summary

Background
Last week Saturday, I attended an Excel workshop which is organised by my course society at my campus. On that day, I have learnt some basic techniques and concepts in Microsoft Excel. Overall, the learning topic of the day can be categorized into three sub-sections which are lookup functions, logical functions and text functions.</description>

      <description>Corrr package
From my previous post, I did mention about the use of network plot from ‘corrr’ package in visualizing correlation matrices. So, for this time, I’m going to share with you on how to create your own correlation network plot by using ‘corrr’ package in a quick way and also how do we actually interpret it in short.

Installation
Download and install the ‘corrr’ and ‘magrittr’ R packages from CRAN for the first time before we can make use of the functions from it.</description>

      <title>A hint on how to read World Bank data into R</title>
      <link>/post/read-world-bank-data-into-r/</link>

      <description>World Bank is an ideal place for us to access global development data. We can always search suitable open data by relevant keyword and download it in any format we prefer (CSV, XML, EXCEL). However, if you are the guy who prefers to wrangle data with R, then there is another option for you to deal with it instead of download open data from World Bank into your pc and import into R manually by using read.</description>

*Hypothesis test about a population mean, \(\mu\)

*Hypothesis test about a population proportion, p


Introduction
A hypothesis test is a standard procedure for testing a claim about a property of a population. A formal hypothesis test has few components which includes null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, test statistics, p-value, tail of test, type I and type II error.

A population parameter is a statistical measure that for a given population is fixed and can be used in the description of that population.</description>

      <description>During my semester one in year two, I was given the opportunity to take part in the annual IBM Watson Analytics competition. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I did learn a lot of things from it. One of them was how to make use of R in wrangling datasets. It was my first time to join and words couldn’t explain my feelings and gratitude towards my academic advisor for her approach, guidance and patience.</description>
