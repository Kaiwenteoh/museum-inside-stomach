I’m a second-year student who is currently studying Statistical Computing and Operations Research at University Tunku Abdul Rahman in Perak, Malaysia. I don’t cook but I do like carbonara spaghetti, ikan bakar, almond dessert, and many more.

BlogThis blog is about statistics, operations research, data analysis and its visualization while using mainly R, and a little bit of my life.</description>

      <description>World Bank is an ideal place for us to access global development data. We can always search suitable open data by relevant keyword and download it in any format we prefer (CSV, XML, EXCEL). However, if you are the guy who prefers to wrangle data with R, then there is another option for you to deal with it instead of download open data from World Bank into your pc and import into R manually by using read.</description>

Introduction
A hypothesis test is a standard procedure for testing a claim about a property of a population. A formal hypothesis test has few components which includes null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, test statistics, p-value, tail of test, type I and type II error.

A population parameter is a statistical measure that for a given population is fixed and can be used in the description of that population.</description>

      <description>During my semester one in year two, I was given the opportunity to take part in Watson analytics competition which organised by IBM Watsons annually. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I did learnt a lot of things from it. One of it is how to make use of R in wrangling datasets. It was my first time to join and words can’t explain my feelings and gratitude to my academic advisor for her approach, guidance and patience.</description>
