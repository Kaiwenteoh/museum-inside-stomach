#About Me

----------------------------------

  Hi, my name is Kaiwen Teoh but you can just call me Kalvin. I'm a second-year student who is currently studying Statistical Computing and Operations Research at University Tunku Abdul Rahman in Perak, Malaysia. I don't cook but I do like carbonara spaghetti, ikan bakar, almond dessert, and many more.

# Blog

----------------------------------------------

  This blog is about statistics, operations research, data analysis and its visualization while using mainly R, and a little bit of my life. 
  
  The main reason for creating this website is to enhance my learning experience through technology. I admit I'm one of the victims who learnt a lot of theories but never knowing how to make actual use of them, be it mathematical ones or life philosophies. This inspired me to create my very own website so I can share what I've learnt here and at the same time use it as my personal ~~documentation~~ notepad. 

  This static site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using [Minimal](https://github.com/calintat/minimal) theme which deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). You can always find my fun on [post](http://kaiwen-teoh.netlify.com/post/) menu and [博客](http://kalvinkaiwen.blogspot.my/) is my mandarin blog since 2015 which consists of my random thoughts, emotions in my life.
