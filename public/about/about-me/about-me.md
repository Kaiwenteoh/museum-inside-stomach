  Hi, my name is Kaiwen Teoh and you can call me Kalvin in case you found my name is difficult to remember. Year two student who study Statistical Computing and Operational Research at University of Tunku Abdul Rahman in Malaysia. I don't cook but I do like spaghetti carbonara, ikan bakar, almond dessert and more. 
  
  This blog is about statistics, operational research, data analysis, life and visualization with a special focus on R. The main reason that I create this website is to enhance my learning experience through techonlogy. I must admit that I'm one of the victim who learn a lot of theories but never know how to make use of them in solving my real life problems. So, if I found and learnt something new which is fun and interesting, it will be posted and illustrated here, mostly about R and study stuff as a ~~documentation~~ note for myself as well as tutorial for you.
  
  You can always reach me by [email](kalvin_kaiwen@hotmail.com), [twitter](https://twitter.com/Kalvin_kaiwen) and my R code, Markdown files will be available in my [github](https://github.com/Kaiwenteoh/museum-inside-stomach). Feel free to leave relevant comments and any suggestions will be much appreciated and welcomed.
