      <description>World Bank is an ideal place for us to access global development data. We can always search suitable open data by relevant keyword and download open data in any format we prefer (CSV, XML, EXCEL). However, if you are the guy who prefers to wrangle data with R, then there is another option to deal with it instead of download open data from World Bank into your pc and import into R manually by using read.</description>

Introduction
A hypothesis test is a standard procedure for testing a claim about a property of a population. A formal hypothesis test has few components which include null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, test statistics, tail of test, type I and type II error.

The null hypothesis which denoted by \(H_0\) is a statement that the value of population parameter is assumed to be true until it is declared false.</description>

      <description>During my semester one in year two, I was given the opportunity to take part in Watson analytics competition which organised by IBM Watsons annually. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I did learnt a lot of things from it. One of it is how to make use of R in wrangling datasets. It was my first time to join and words canâ€™t explain my feelings and gratitude to my academic advisor for her approach, guidance and patience.</description>
