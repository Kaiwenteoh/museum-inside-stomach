#<a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction

  <br>
  <br>

  A **hypothesis test** is a standard procedure for testing a claim about a property of a population. A formal hypothesis test has few components which include null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, test statistics, tail of test, type I and type II error. 
  
  <br>
  
  The **null hypothesis** which denoted by $H_0$ is a statement that the value of population parameter is assumed to be true until it is declared false.  
  
  <br>
  
  The **alternative hypothesis** which denoted by $H_1$ is a statement that the population parameter has a value that somehow differs from the value specified in the null hypothesis, $H_0$. 
  
  <br>
  
  While **test statistic** is a value that we compute from the sample of data and it is crucial in determining whether our null hypothesis, $H_0$ is rejected or not.
  
  <br>
  
  A hypothesis test can be a **one-tailed test** or **two-tailed test** depends on the situation. A one-tailed test can be divided into a left-tailed and right-tailed test. If the sign in the null hypothesis, $H_0$ is equal (=), then a two-tailed test should be performed instead of one-tailed test. For a left-tailed test, the sign for the value of population parameter in the null hypothesis, $H_0$ should be greater than equal ($\ge$), while for a right-tailed test, sign for the null hypothesis, $H_0$ is less than equal ($\le$). 
  
  <br>

  A **type I error** occurs when we reject the true null hypothesis, $H_O$ while a **type II error** occurs when a false null hypothesis, $H_0$ is not rejected. The probability of making type I error is known as significance level, $\alpha$ and the probability of making type II error is denoted as $\beta$.

# One-Sample Hypothesis Testing

  <br>

## <a id="Hypothesis test about a population mean, $\mu$"></a>Hypothesis test about a population mean, $\mu$  
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  In tests of hypothesis about a single population mean, $\mu$, we perform Z-test when the sample is large (n $\ge$ 30).  
  
  <br>
  <br>

### <a id="Z-test"></a>Z-test

  <br>
  <br>
  
  Since base library of R doesn't provide the function of Z-test, so we have to download and install the required R package, ["BSDA"](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/BSDA/versions/1.2.0) which stands for **Basic Statistics and Data Analysis** from CRAN.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r message=FALSE, eval=F}

install.packages("BSDA")          
# Install required R package

```

  <br>
  <br>
  
  Then we load the library in console and use z.test( ) function to check the claim of the null hypothesis, $H_0$.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r message=F, comment=NA, eval=F}

library("BSDA")                   
# Load "BSDA" 

z.test(x, alternative = "two.sided"/"greater"/"less", mu, sigma.x, conf.level)
# Z-test

```

#### Example 1
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  A company's marketing department claims that the average time of their staffs late to work in a working day is 5 minutes with a standard deviation of 1.29 minutes. The human resource department of the company wishes to check the claims whether it is true or not in order to improve company's reputation. A sample of 35 people from marketing department late to work time in minutes is determined and recorded. The collected sample data for a working day is indicated as below:
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r message=F, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Times <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Number, ~Late.time.in.minutes,
        1,                     2,
        2,                    10,
        3,                     7,
        4,                     8,
        5,                     8,
        6,                     0,
        7,                     7,
        8,                     6,
        9,                     1,
       10,                     0,
       11,                     1,
       12,                     5,
       13,                     8,
       14,                     8,
       15,                     6,
       16,                     9,
       17,                     9,
       18,                    10,
       19,                     6,
       20,                     1,
       21,                     4,
       22,                     0,
       23,                     7,
       24,                     7,
       25,                     3,
       26,                    10,
       27,                     0,
       28,                     1,
       29,                     3,
       30,                     6,
       31,                     1,
       32,                     4,
       33,                     0,
       34,                     0,
       35,                    10
  )

require(rhandsontable)
rhandsontable(Times, rowHeaders = NULL,
               digits = 3, useTypes = FALSE, search = FALSE,
               width = NULL, height = NULL)

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r}

late_time= read.csv(file.choose())                       
# Read file into R

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r eval=F}

library("BSDA")
# Load "BSDA" package

late_to_work= late_time$Late.time.in.minutes                          
# Store data into "late_to_work" 

z.test(late_to_work, alternative="two.sided", mu=5, sigma.x=1.29,conf.level = 0.95)  
# Z-test with 5% significance level

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}

library("BSDA")

late_to_work= late_time$Late.time.in.minutes                          

z.test(late_to_work, alternative="two.sided", mu=5, sigma.x=1.29,conf.level = 0.95)  

```

  <br>
  <br>
  
  From the above summary, it can be concluded that the claim by the marketing department is true and valid since p-value= 0.359 is greater than the significance level, $\alpha$ which is equal to 0.05. Besides, the population mean, $\mu$ which is equal to 5 minutes is also within the 95% confidence interval (4.37263, 5.22737). Thus, the average time of marketing staffs late to work for a day is 5 minutes.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

### T-test

  <br>
  <br>
  
  In tests of hypothesis about a single population mean, $\mu$, we perform T-test when
  
  * The sample is small (n<30).
  * Standard deviation, $\sigma$ of the population is **not known**.
  * The sample is drawn from a population which is approximately normally distributed.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r eval=FALSE}

t.test(x, alternative = "two.sided"/"greater"/"less", mu, conf.level)
# T-test 

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
#### Example 2

  <br>
  <br>
  
  A company's marketing department claims that the average time of their staffs late to work in a day is 5 minutes with a standard deviation of 1.29 minutes. As a human resource manager, you are required to test the claims whether it is longer than 5 minutes. A sample of 15 people from marketing department late to work time in minutes for a day is determined and recorded. The sample data is indicated as below:
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r message=F, echo=FALSE}

Times_2 <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Number, ~Late.time.in.minutes,
        1,                     9,
        2,                     3,
        3,                     9,
        4,                     3,
        5,                    10,
        6,                     1,
        7,                     7,
        8,                     2,
        9,                     5,
       10,                     7,
       11,                     6,
       12,                     9,
       13,                     6,
       14,                     1,
       15,                     6
  )

require(rhandsontable)
rhandsontable(Times_2, rowHeaders = NULL,
               digits = 3, useTypes = FALSE, search = FALSE,
               width = NULL, height = NULL)


```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r eval=FALSE}

late_time_min= read.csv(file.choose())
# Read file into R

late_time_min= late_time_min$Late.time.in.minutes                          
# Store data into "late_time_min" 

t.test(late_time_min, alternative="greater", mu=5, conf.level = 0.95)  
# T-test with 5% significance level

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r comment=NA, echo=F, message=F}

late_time_min= read.csv(file.choose())
# Read file into R

late_time_min= late_time_min$Late.time.in.minutes                          
# Store data into "late_time_min" 

t.test(late_time_min, alternative="greater", mu=5, conf.level = 0.95)  

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  From the above summary, it can be concluded that the claim by the marketing department is true and valid since p-value= 0.2271 is greater than significance level which is equal to 0.05. Besides, the population mean, $\mu$ which is equal to 5 minutes is also within the 95% confidence interval (4.22706, Inf). Thus, the average time of marketing staffs late to work for a working day is 5 minutes.
  
  <br>
  <br>

### Small sample size with known standard deviation, $\sigma$
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  Perform [Z-test](#Z-test) instead of T-test for small sample size when:
  
  * The sample size is small (n<30).
  * Standard deviation, $\sigma$ of the population is **known**.
  * The sample is drawn from a population which is approximately normally distributed.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  
## <a id="Hypothesis test about a population proportion, p"></a>Hypothesis test about a population proportion, p

  <br>
  <br>
  
  In tests of hypothesis about a single population proportion, p, we perform Z-test when the sample is large (np>5, nq>5).  
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
### Z-test (proprotion)

  <br>
  <br>

```{r eval=F}

prop.test(x, n, p, alternative="greater", correct=FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)            
# Z-test for population proportion

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
#### Example3

  <br>
  <br>
  
  A company's marketing department claims that at most 80% of their staffs are late to work within 5 minutes for a working day. The human resource department of the company is responsible to test the claims whether it is valid or not in order to improve company's reputation. A sample 120 marketing staffs showed that 89 of them are late to work within 5 minutes in a working day.

  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r eval=F}

prop.test(89, 120, 0.80, alternative = "greater", correct= FALSE, conf.level = 0.975)            

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r message=F, echo=F, comment=NA}

prop.test(89, 120, 0.80, alternative = "greater", correct= FALSE, conf.level = 0.975)    

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  From the above summary, p-value = 0.9449 is greater than the significance level, $\alpha$ which is equal to 0.025. Besides, the population proportion, p= 0.8 is also falls within the 97.5% confidence interval (0.6567, 1.0000). Thus, the claim by the marketing department is true which is at most 80% of their staff are late to work within 5 minutes for a working day.
