  During my semester one in year two, I was given the opportunity to take part in Watson analytics competition which organised by IBM Watsons annually. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I did learnt a lot of things from it. One of it is how to make use of R in wrangling datasets. It was my first time to join and words can't explain my feelings and gratitude to my academic advisor for her approach, guidance and patience. 

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  
## Reading data into R
  <br>
  
  Before we store our dataset into a variable, we have to download it. [Here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.GHGT.KT.CE) is the open data which I took from [The Word Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/). 
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r message=FALSE}

data1=read.csv(file.choose())         # read csv file into R and store in a named variable

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  'file.choose( )' function is an alternative for you to select downloaded file and read into R. You can also replace it with your filename in 'filename.csv' format inside the parentheses of 'read.csv( )' function if you prefer to do so.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  Print the output of 'data1' into R console in data frame occupies large space and it is undesirable. One way to deal with it is to change the class of 'data1' from data frame to tibble. And this require to load the *Tibble* package from *Tidyverse* library. *Tidyverse* is my personal favourite and it consists list of useful analysis R packages like *ggplot2*, *tidyr*, *dyplr* and more.

  <br>
  <br>

```{r collapse=TRUE, comment=NA, message=FALSE}

nrow(data1)                            # check number of rows for variable

ncol(data1)                            # check number of columns for variable

```

  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r message=FALSE, comment=NA, collapse=TRUE}

library('tidyverse')                   # load library

class(data1)                           # determine the class of variable

data1=as.tibble(data1)                 # change class of variable and store

class(data1)

```

  <br>
  <br>

  Class of 'data1' variable changed from data frame to tibble. And the following output is produced.
  
  <br>
  <br>

```{r collapse=T, comment=NA}  

data1                                  # print output

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  
## Data wrangling on R
  <br>

  As output produced is not in tidy format(one variable in one column and every observations have its row), it is difficult for us to do our analysis and visualize later. Not only that, in this case, there are some variables which you might have no interest to include it in tibble(table) like 'Indicator.name' and 'Indicator.Code'. To overcome these kind of issues, *dplyr* and *tidyr* from *Tidyverse* library are always helpful in manipulating and tidying data.
  
  So, we have a scenario here. Let say we want to include the name of countries and their amount of green house gasses released from 2008 to 2011 by 4 columns. First column is for the list of countries, while second column is for code of countries, third column is for years and fourth column is for total green house gasses released in kilo tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.
  
  <br>
  <br>

###I
  
```{r collapse=TRUE, comment=NA,eval=FALSE}

data1=select(data1,Country.Name,Country.Code,X2008,X2009,X2010,X2011)   

# select desired variables

data1=gather(data1,'X2008','X2009','X2010','X2011',key='Year',value='Total greenhouse gas emissions (kt of CO2 equivalent)')    

# tidy data                                                                      

```

  <br>
  <br>
  
  '%>%' is a pipe operator which indicates 'and then'. Pipe operator is a convenient tool from *Magrittr* package but when we have *Tidyverse* library, it will be unnecessary for us to intall and load *Magrittr* package manually because it's part of the library. 
  
  By using '%>%', we will get the same output with above code in one shot.

  <br>
  <br>

###II
  
```{r comment=NA,collapse=TRUE}

data1=data1 %>% select(Country.Name,Country.Code,X2008,X2009,X2010,X2011) %>% gather('X2008','X2009','X2010','X2011',key='Year',value='Total greenhouse gas emissions (kt of CO2 equivalent)')

# select() specifies which column you wish to include by column name

# gather() tidy data 

data1           

```

  <br>
  <br>
  
  4 different years from 2008 to 2011 are grouped into a column named 'Year', and it's data are grouped into another column named 'Total greenhouse gas emissions (kt of CO2 equivalent)'. Because of this dataset consists total of 1056 rows so by default tibble can only shows up to 10 rows. You can always change this default mannually or even show the top or bottom of dataset.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r collapse=TRUE, comment=NA}

options(tibble.print_min=50)          # change the default to print 50 rows

head(data1,20)                        # show 30 rows from top

tail(data1,20)                        # show 30 rows from bottom

```

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  
## Gsub function
  <br>
  
  I never found gsub( ) function is so useful until I met this problem during that time. As you can notice that in 'Year' colunmn, all the entries are followed by a 'X' character. By using gsub( ) function, this issue is not longer an issue anymore.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r comment=NA, collapse=TRUE}

data1$Year=gsub('X','',data1$Year)               # replace 'X' character with empty

data1[1:20, ]                                    # diplay first 20 rows

```

  <br>
  <br>
  
  Try View( ) function in Rstudio or Rgui to prints the whole result in another tab, so that you can have look on it, instead of print the large dataset on console.   
  
  To modify your dataset like filling in missing values or adding new column to your datasets, use edit( ) command. This command works exactly like View( ) function except it provides you with the ability to refine data.
  
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
```{r eval=FALSE}

View(data1)               # view output
edit(data1)               # modify data

```
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
