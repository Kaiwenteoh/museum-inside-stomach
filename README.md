# museum-inside-stomach

  Hi, my name is Kai Wen. 'Museum-Inside-Stomach" is a repository which consists of my content from my currently running website on https://kaiwen.space/.
  
  This static website is built by using the R package, 'Blogdown' by Yihui Xie. My blog is about the use of R in statistics, data analysis and little bit of my life. Plan to learn other programming languages like Julia, Python in data science and share with you guys in future.  
  
  At here, I welcome any passion people from different educational backgrounds to join me on the journey of continuous learning and growth. Thank you.
